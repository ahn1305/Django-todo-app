This Todo app is made with django 2.1.5, and this project will be good for beginners to learn the basic concepts.

Now lets see how the app works,

First you need to add a new task and submit, and it will be displayed with 2 buttons update and delete option

If you select update option you will be shown the title of the task which you selected and a check box. If you tick the check box and update your task your can find a strike on the task, you can remove the strike by unticking the check box and update, you can also change the task's title.

If you select the delete option you will be asked for a confirmation to delete that particular post you selected, if you select the submit button, your task will be deleted and vice versa...

So this is the functionality of the app.
